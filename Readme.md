# About the project

This wordpress project is for my learning purposes. I am following the [Brad Schiff 's udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/). Aside from wordpress, I'm trying to containerize services for wordpress to run.

## Project structure

1. Nginx
2. Php 7.4 with FPM installed
3. Mysql 5.7
4. Wordpress
5. Docker :D
